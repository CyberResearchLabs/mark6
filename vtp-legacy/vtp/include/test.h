 * *** empty log message ***
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2003/09/10 00:21:16  davidlapsley
 * Modified build system.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2003/09/09 22:30:15  davidlapsley
 * - Added XML parser to the main branch. Converted configuration from
 * command line driven to configuration file driven (too many parameters
 * for the command line).
 * - Integrated server with RTP/RTCP logic.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2003/09/09 05:57:42  davidlapsley
 * - Removed members and senders from rtcp_member_t (this logic already
 * maintained in OnReceive).
 * - Completed rtcp_send_report(), rtcp_send_bye() functions.
 * - Made buffer sizes in rtcp_session_t an initialization parameter.
 * - client.c: integrating rtcp module
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2003/09/08 21:54:28  davidlapsley
 * - Added random module for generating random 32 bit integers.
 * - Replaced u_intXX style typedefs with standard u_intXX_t types.
 * - Added variables to rtcp_t session member.
 * - Added code file template: template.h which includes the MIT license
 * header.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2003/09/04 22:07:52  davidlapsley
 * Added new module: members to encapsulate the member tree. The member
 * tree consists of a struct: members_t that encapsulates a glib balances
 * tree. This tree is used to store a list of session members and their
 * state.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/09/03 12:54:02  davidlapsley
 * Added CVS header to each source file.
