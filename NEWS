Release 0.2	7/7/2011	David Lapsley<del@haystack.mit.edu>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION

Major performance milestone.

Using a a single 10 GE network interface, and a single disk pack 
(with only 7 disks, one has failed), able to get ~ 7.6 Gbps net
to disk throughput (with 3% packet loss and ~95% utilization of a
single CPU -- out of 16 total CPUs). Throughput on both transmit
and receive checked, and volume of data written over test interval
checked. Test duraiton was 30 seconds.

FEATURES

- Ported code to debian squeeze (6.0.2) with 2.6.32 kernel.
- Removed source dependencies in favor of binary debian packages.
- Incorporated PF_RING module source into build tree.
- Upgraded "setup" build script. Includes more user accessible
  functionality. Also automatically installs all packages required
  to create a build/development machine from scratch.
- net2disk module now fully based on PF_RING architecture.
- Added tools subdirectory with network and disk configuration scripts.
  Disk configuration scripts include optimizations that disable
  journaling on ext4 file systems and enable driver level throughput
  optimizations.
